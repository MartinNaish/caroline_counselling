			<h2>What is counselling?</h2>
			<p>Counselling provides the opportunity to think through the things that are causing distress, with an impartial, trained professional uninvolved in any other area of your life.</p>
			<p>As a counsellor I do not give advice, as that would mean imposing my values on you. Instead, in a calm setting uninterrupted by the usual distractions of modern life, the emphasis is on confidentiality, support and understanding. I can help identify links between relationships and issues in your past, and your present-day ways of relating to others.</p>
			<p>Awareness of these connections offers you the freedom to choose whether and how to change old patterns of behaviour.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="howcan">
			<h2>How can counselling help?</h2>
			<p>People come to counselling for a variety of reasons: with relationship difficulties, with anxiety or depression, after loss or bereavement, or through an undefined sense of unhappiness with life and a wish to change. I listen non-judgementally to any issues you want to discuss and together we think about how you deal with life. Counselling can alleviate anxiety, help come to terms with trauma, accept the past, and help you to move on to live life in a different way.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="howlong">
			<h2>How long does counselling take?</h2>
			<p>Each session lasts 50 minutes and we meet regularly on a weekly basis. We decide together the number of sessions that are suitable for you. Sometimes a few sessions are enough to provide support through a difficult period. If you are looking for more substantial change, more sessions may be appropriate.</p>

		<div id="price">
			<h2>Price</h2>
			<p>I currently charge &pound;45 per session. This increases slightly every two years.</p>
